mytweets
========

A simple script to back up all of your tweets in to a local file.
It can save them in JSON, XML, or in Python's pickle format

Dependencies:

- httplib2 from http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/
- simplejson (unless Python 2.6) from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/

Usage:

1. To specify your username and passowrd, you can either
   create a file called config.py in the same directory as the script:

USERNAME = 'your-twitter-username'
PASSWORD = 'your-twitter-password'

   or use the -u and -p options on the command line.

2. Run the command like so:

python fetch.py [-u your-twitter-username] [-p your-twitter-password] [-x] [-t]

3. If you use the -x option, your tweets will be saved to my_tweets.xml.
   The -t option will save your tweets to my_tweets.txt.  Your tweets
   will always be saved to my_tweets.json.

You can run the command again any time to save new tweets created since you 
last ran the script.
